                <p>My name is Sergey Samokhin, and I am 18 years old. In 2023, I enrolled in the Mechanics and Mathematics Faculty
                    and am currently studying in my second year. In my childhood, I played hockey professionally,
                    which helped me develop qualities such as discipline, stress resilience, and a sense of responsibility.
                    During my teenage years, I enjoyed making videos for YouTube and also engaged in web programming. I am an activist
                    in a student organization and have experience in organizing events.</p>
